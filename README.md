# BirdNameStudy
### A linguistic study of generalizations underlying common bird names.

This study examines the modifying word in common bird names, such as the  *song* in *song sparrow*. In particular, it compares
the names of birds of prey with the names of non-birds of prey. This study is restricted
to birds in North America, or more specifically the United States and Canada. This is because birds in non-English
speaking regions may have come into English via loanwords, or via the naming conventions or discretionary decisions of
a restricted set of people (i.e.: scientists).

Some of the files in this project contain bird name data (from Clements Checklist), scripts for restructuring the data,
a NamedBird class definition, and utility methods for conducting analysis.

The analysis is implemented in study.py, which will display results at the end via the console. The names of descriptive
data therein are self-explanatory. One which may require an explanation is the notion of embeddedness; the embeddedness
of set A in set B is the proportion of elements in set A that are also in set B, or #(A int B)/#A.
